The Duck

**Note:** I'm not actually entirely sure where the art first came from because I saw it both [here](https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/1548181165504799/) and [here](https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/pixel-pit-on-instagram-mallard-duck-pixelart-duck-ducks-aseprite-digitalart-digitalartwork-pixelartwork-pixelartist-pixels-pixel-art--137641332355086962/), but it is not my own, I just pieced it back together to be printed on the terminal.
